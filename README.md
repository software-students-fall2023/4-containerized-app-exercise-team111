## Description

The machine learning client implemented image recognition feature, being able to identify objects within the image with a percentage match to
indicate the plausibility of matching object in the image. The web app connects to the machine client, allowing users to upload image to utilize the aforementioned picture. All data will be stored with pymongo and delievered to the users by it.
